# Photoluminescence-data-analysis
Here are codes for analysing the 2D photoluminescence data. Functions are plotting out the 2D maps and extracting the spectra according to the specified excitation and emission wavelength.

# Features #
## Photoluminescence map plotting ##

## Extracting emission and photoluminescence-excitation spectra based on specified emission or excitation wavelength. ##

## Calculating the transition energies of single-walled carbon nanotubes based on the many-body theoretical model. ##
