# Photoluminescence-data-analysis
Here are codes for analysing the 2D photoluminescence data. Functions include plotting out the 2D maps and extracting spectra at the specified excitation and emission wavelengths.

# Features #
## Plotting photoluminescence map along with noise filtering ##

## Extracting emission and photoluminescence-excitation spectra based on specified emission or excitation wavelength. ##

## Calculating the transition energies of single-walled carbon nanotubes based on the many-body theoretical model. ##

Note: This part of the script is in a separate file and was not included here in the first instance.
